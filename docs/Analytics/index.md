## Analytics

### Amazon Athena*
Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive analytics service built on open-source frameworks, supporting open-table and file formats. Athena provides a simplified, flexible way to analyze petabytes of data where it lives. Analyze data or build applications from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) data lake and 30 data sources, including on-premises data sources or other cloud systems using SQL or Python. Athena is built on open-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no provisioning or configuration effort required.

### AWS Data Exchange*
AWS Data Exchange makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange and use third-party data on AWS. Data analysts, product managers, portfolio managers, data scientists, quants, clinical trial technicians, and developers in nearly every industry would like access to more data to drive analytics, train machine learning (ML) models, and make data-driven decisions. But there is no one place to find data from multiple providers and no consistency in how providers deliver data, leaving them to deal with a mix of shipped physical media, FTP credentials, and bespoke API calls. Conversely, many organizations would like to make their data available for either research or commercial purposes, but it's too hard and expensive to build and maintain data delivery, entitlement, and billing technology, which further depresses the supply of valuable data.

### Amazon EMR*
Amazon EMR Serverless is a new option in Amazon EMR that makes it easy and cost-effective for data engineers and analysts to run applications built using open source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark, Hive, or Presto, without having to tune, operate, optimize, secure, or manage clusters. It's a managed cluster platform for running big data frameworks like Apache Spark and Hadoop.

### AWS Glue*
AWS Glue: Preparing your data to obtain quality results is the first step in an analytics or ML project. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes data preparation simpler, faster, and cheaper. You can discover and connect to over 70 diverse data sources, manage your data in a centralized data catalog, and visually create, run, and monitor ETL pipelines to load data into your data lakes. AWS Glue is a fully managed, pay-as-you-go, extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that automates the time-consuming steps of data preparation for analytics.

AWS Glue automatically discovers and profiles data via the Glue Data Catalog, recommends and generates ETL code to transform your source data into target schemas. It runs the ETL jobs on a fully managed, scale-out Apache Spark environment to load your data into its destination. AWS Glue also allows you to set up, orchestrate, and monitor complex data flows. You can create and run an ETL job with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Use AWS Glue to discover properties of data, transform it, and prepare it for analytics. Glue can automatically discover both structured and semi-structured data stored in data lakes on Amazon S3, data warehouses in Amazon Redshift, and various databases running on AWS. It provides a unified view of data via the Glue Data Catalog that is available for ETL, querying, and reporting using services like Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum. Glue automatically generates Scala or Python code for ETL jobs that you can further customize using tools you are already familiar with. AWS Glue is serverless, so there are no compute resources to configure and manage.

### Amazon Kinesis*
Amazon Kinesis: Collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. Ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications. Process and analyze data as it arrives and respond instantly instead of having to wait until all your data is collected before the processing can begin. Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. It's a collection of services for processing streams of various data. Data is processed in "shards." There are four types of Kinesis service, and these are detailed below:

- Kinesis Video Streams
- Kinesis Data Streams
- Kinesis Data Firehose
- Kinesis Data Analytics

### Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)*
Amazon MSK makes it easy to ingest and process streaming data in real time with fully managed Apache Kafka.

### Amazon OpenSearch Service*
Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service that makes it easy for you to perform interactive log analytics, real-time application monitoring, website search, and more.

### Amazon QuickSight*
Amazon QuickSight is a very fast, easy-to-use, cloud-powered business analytics service that makes it easy for all employees within an organization to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data, anytime, on any device. Upload CSV and Excel files; connect to SaaS applications like Salesforce; access on-premises databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL; and seamlessly discover your AWS data sources such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Athena, and Amazon S3. QuickSight enables organizations to scale their business analytics capabilities to hundreds of thousands of users, and delivers fast and responsive query performance by using a robust in-memory engine (SPICE).

### Amazon Redshift
Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data. It's massively scalable, with Redshift nodes in multiple petabyte sizes being very common. In cooperation with Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can directly run a single SQL query against exabytes of unstructured data running in data lakes. Redshift uses a variety of innovations that allow you to achieve up to 10 times higher performance than traditional databases when it comes to these kinds of business intelligence workloads. The key for you is to understand that when you need big data BI solutions, Redshift allows you to get started with a single API call. Less time waiting for results, more time getting answers.
