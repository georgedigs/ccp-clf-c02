# Customer Engagement:

## AWS Activate for Startups*

Millions of customers, including thousands of the fastest-growing startups, use AWS to build fast, keep costs low, and prove what's possible.

## AWS IQ*

AWS IQ allows you to describe your needs, get responses from experts and consulting firms, and choose the expert(s) or consulting firm(s) with the skills and experience you need. Then, you can agree to a proposal and payment type with the expert or consulting firm and set a budget. For upfront or scheduled payments, you will agree to the payments when accepting the proposal. For milestone payments, your expert or consulting firm will send you payment requests as agreed to in the proposal or when milestones are met. All payments and the associated charges will be charged to the payment method in your AWS bill.
