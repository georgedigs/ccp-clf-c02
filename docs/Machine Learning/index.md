Native interoperability with AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudWatch and easy integration with many other services on the AWS platform including Amazon Cognito, and Amazon DynamoDB makes bot development effortless.

### Amazon Polly\*

_Amazon Polly_ uses deep learning technologies to synthesize natural-sounding human speech, so you can convert articles to speech. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages, use Amazon Polly to build speech-activated applications.

### Amazon Rekognition\*

_Amazon Rekognition_ is a service that makes it easy to add powerful visual analysis to your applications. Rekognition Image lets you easily build powerful applications to search, verify, and organize millions of images. Rekognition Video lets you extract motion-based context from stored or live stream videos and helps you analyze them.

Rekognition Image is an image recognition service that detects objects, scenes, activities, landmarks, faces, dominant colors, and image quality. Rekognition Image also extracts text, recognizes celebrities, and identifies inappropriate content in images. It also allows you to search and compare faces.

### Amazon SageMaker\*

_Amazon SageMaker_ To make it easier to get started, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart provides a set of solutions for the most common use cases that can be deployed readily with just a few clicks.

Prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for machine learning.

Amazon SageMaker is available for free, for 2 months, as part of the AWS Free Tier program. Users can get access to 250 hours per month of ml.t3.medium notebooks usage with the Free Tier.

### Amazon Textract\*

_Amazon Textract_ is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration (which often must be updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and act on the information extracted, whether you're automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days. Additionally, you can add human reviews with Amazon Augmented AI to provide oversight of your models and check sensitive data.

Automatically extract printed text, handwriting, and data from any document.

### Amazon Transcribe\*

_Amazon Transcribe_ is an AWS Artificial Intelligence (AI) service that makes it easy for you to convert speech to text. Using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology, you can use Amazon Transcribe for a variety of business applications, including transcription of voice-based customer service calls, generation of subtitles on audio/video content, and conduct (text-based) content analysis on audio/video content.

Add speech to text capabilities to applications.

Recorded speech can be converted to text before it can be used in applications.

Uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately.

### Amazon Translate\*

_Amazon Translate_ is a Neural Machine Translation (MT) service for translating text between supported languages. Powered by deep learning methods, the service provides high-quality, affordable, and customizable language translation, enabling developers to translate company and user-authored content, or build applications requiring support across multiple languages. The service can be used via an API, enabling either real-time or batch translation of text from the source language to the target language.

Neural machine translation service that delivers fast, high-quality, and affordable language translation.

Uses deep learning models to deliver more accurate and more natural sounding translation.

Localize content such as websites and applications for your diverse users.
