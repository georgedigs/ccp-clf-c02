## Application Integration:

### Amazon EventBridge\*

_Amazon EventBridge_ makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated SaaS applications, and AWS services.

To get started, you can choose an event source on the EventBridge console. You can then select a target from AWS services including AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. EventBridge will automatically deliver the events in near real-time.

### Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

### Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS

is a publish/subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers. This is similar to the coffee shop; the cashier provides coffee orders to the barista who makes the drinks.

In Amazon SNS, subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, AWS Lambda functions, or several other options.

### Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)

### Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)

is a message queuing service. Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.

### AWS Step Functions\*

_AWS Step Functions_ is a fully managed service that makes it easier to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function helps you scale more easily and change applications more quickly.

Step Functions is a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your application. Step Functions provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. This makes it easier to build and run multi-step applications.

Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems more quickly. You can change and add steps without even writing code, so you can more easily evolve your application and innovate faster. Business Applications:
