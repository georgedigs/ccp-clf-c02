# Developer Tools:

## AWS AppConfig*

AWS AppConfig, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, is used to create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. A configuration is a collection of settings that influence the behavior of your application. You can use AWS AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices. To view examples of the types of configurations you can manage using AWS AppConfig, see Example configurations.

## AWS CLI*

AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features, including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO), and various interactive features.

## AWS Cloud9*

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.

It comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and PHP.

You can quickly share your development environment with your team, enabling you to pair program and track each other's inputs in real-time.

## AWS CloudShell*

AWS CloudShell, a browser-based shell, allows you to quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), experiment with service APIs using the AWS CLI, and use other tools to increase your productivity. The CloudShell icon appears in AWS Regions where CloudShell is available.

## AWS CodeArtifact*

CodeArtifact allows you to store artifacts using popular package managers and build tools like Maven, Gradle, npm, Yarn, Twine, pip, and NuGet. CodeArtifact can automatically fetch software packages on demand from public package repositories so you can access the latest versions of application dependencies.

## AWS CodeBuild*

AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles source code, runs tests, and produces packages that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. CodeBuild automatically scales up and down and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds don't have to wait in a queue. You can get started quickly by using CodeBuild prepackaged build environments, or you can use custom build environments to use your own build tools. With CodeBuild, you only pay by the minute.

## AWS CodeCommit*

AWS CodeCommit is a secure, highly scalable, fully managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories.

## AWS CodeDeploy*

CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.

## AWS CodePipeline*

AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates.

## AWS CodeStar*

AWS CodeStar is a cloud-based development service that provides the tools you need to quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. With AWS CodeStar, you can set up your entire continuous delivery toolchain in minutes, allowing you to start releasing code faster. AWS CodeStar makes it easy for your whole team to work together securely, with built-in role-based policies that allow you to easily manage access and add owners, contributors, and viewers to your projects. Each AWS CodeStar project comes with a unified project dashboard and integration with Atlassian JIRA software, a third-party issue tracking and project management tool. With the AWS CodeStar project dashboard, you can easily track your entire software development process, from a backlog work item to production code deployment.

## AWS X-Ray*

AWS X-Ray provides a complete view of requests as they travel through your application and filters visual data across payloads, functions, traces, services, APIs, and more with no-code and low-code motions.
